          <p class="card-text">Higher down time, inefficiencies in the system and higher maintenance costs can cripple day-to-day operations. Standard service network and policies have therefore become part of basic hygiene for vehicular maintenance. However, in a relentlessly demanding business, a customer needs more than policy. He’s looking for a promise.<br>

            Our service network and offerings revolve around powering your success. This is why they are designed to ensure highest up time and total continuity in business–no break, no interruption–and when there is a break, the quickest possible turnaround at the lowest possible cost.<br>
            
            Ashok Leyland brings together comprehensive coverage, proactive service and rapid response in a wide gamut of services that include everything our stakeholders might require–from reliable Annual Maintenance Contracts to user-friendly insurance, intuitive maintenance programmes and the latest technology innovations in Telematics.<br></p>
